# Battleships

A C++ Windows desktop game made with SFML. This is an old project. I just self-learned to do some programming in high school and thought it would be a fun idea to make a game in C++ so not knowing that game engines exist I decided to use SFML to do everything myself. Aargh!

Since SFML doesn't include UI components (buttons, text inputs) I had to program them myself. I must admit it was fun. The project is not finished and it's not a playable game because in the middle of making it I found out more exciting things to program. But ship placement and basic menu exist and I think I learned all I needed in this project and decided to abandon it. It was the very first bigger project I did.

## Install

1. Unzip the SFML file and place the SFML folder in the root.
2. Visual studio to run (or use your own compiler)
