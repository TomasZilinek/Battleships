# Battleships

A C++ Windows desktop game made with SFML. This is an old project. I just self-learned to do some programming in high school and thought it would be a fun idea to make a game in C++ so not knowing that game engines exist I decided to use SFML to do everything myself. Aargh! (made in 2018)

Since SFML doesn't include UI components (buttons, text inputs) I had to program them myself. I must admit it was fun. The project is not finished and it's not a playable game because in the middle of making it I found out more exciting things to program. But ship placement and basic menu exist and I think I learned all I needed in this project and decided to abandon it. It was the very first bigger project I did.

## Install

1. Unzip the SFML file and place the SFML folder in the root.
2. Delete the .vs folder if you want to. But if you do it you will have to manually link SFML like in this [video](https://youtu.be/yEiZalvDOj4?si=K4HHl0B0l9rvDUVq)
3. Visual studio with C++ compiler to run (or use your own compiler if you know what you are doing)
